# GameBot

_GameBot_ is the result of a bachelor's thesis in computer science. The goal was to build a physical robot that can play _Tetris_ on a GameBoy. Watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjjjawzBQ4) to see the robot in action.

This repository contains the source code for the software part of the GameBot project.


## Usage

You can test the bot without having a physical robot. This is possible using the [Game Boy emulator](https://meatfighter.com/gameboy) writen by Michael Birken.

You need to download a Game Boy ROM for Tetris to be able to run the application (the file must be copied to `./Roms/tetris.gb`). Due to copyright issues, we can't provide the ROM file directly in this repository.
