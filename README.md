### TODO ###

* Generic interface for searching classes?
* Remove completed lines from board to improve the AI, but still count the completed lines to the heuristic
* Extract level and score from screenshot
* Calculate press duration for "hard drop", use the provided table from here <http://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy)> or make own measurements
* Executer can press button for the specified duration
* Next piece in the game state is only generated if really needed
* Improve performance by optimizing game state transformations
* Precalculate AI decisions?
* Implement possible start settings of the Tetrominos as lookup table instead of a switch case (maybe a little performance boost?)
